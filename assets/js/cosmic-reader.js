            rising: "Your rising sign masks a truth the world has yet to see. The persona you present is but one facet of a multidimensional soul. There's power in the aspects of yourself you keep hidden.",
            deeper: "The complete story lives in your natal chart—a map the universe drew the moment you took your first breath. Planetary aspects reveal timing, challenges, and the unique gifts only you can bring to this world."

            essence: "Virgo sun, Mercury's earth-bound child—you see what others miss, fix what others ignore, perfect what others abandon. Your analytical mind is a gift, but it can also be a labyrinth of overthinking and self-criticism.",
            moon: "Your moon placement suggests emotional patterns you've tried to organize, systematize, perfect. But emotions aren't meant to be controlled, are they? There's healing in surrender.",

        libra: {
            essence: "Libra sun, ruled by Venus—you are harmony seeking harmony, beauty recognizing beauty, justice pursuing justice. Your gift is seeing all sides, but this blessing can become a curse when you lose sight of your own truth.",
            moon: "Your moon placement reveals how you process emotions through the lens of relationship. But what about your relationship with yourself? There's work to be done here, boundaries to be drawn.",
            rising: "Your rising sign presents charm and diplomacy to the world. People see grace, but they don't always see the inner struggle, the constant weighing of options, the fear of making the wrong choice.",
            deeper: "The full natal chart shows you the path to authentic partnership—first with yourself, then with others. There are soul contracts written in your seventh house, karmic relationships that will teach you who you truly are."
        },
        scorpio: {
            essence: "Scorpio sun, child of Pluto's depths—you are intensity incarnate, transformation personified, power wrapped in mystery. You feel everything so deeply it sometimes threatens to consume you. This is both your gift and your challenge.",
            moon: "Your moon placement adds layers to your already complex emotional nature. There are wounds here, deep ones, that you've buried rather than healed. But what we resist persists, doesn't it?",
            rising: "Your rising sign is the mask, the protective coloring that keeps the vultures at bay. But it also keeps out the light. The real you is so much more than the mystery you project.",
            deeper: "Your complete chart reveals cycles of death and rebirth, of shedding skins and emerging transformed. There's shamanic power here, the ability to guide others through their own darkness because you've navigated your own."
        },
        sagittarius: {
            essence: "Sagittarius sun, Jupiter's wandering philosopher—you are the seeker, the adventurer, the eternal student of life's grand university. Your optimism is infectious, but sometimes it's also a defense against facing deeper truths.",
            moon: "Your moon placement suggests an emotional restlessness, a feeling that happiness is always just over the next horizon. But what if everything you seek is already within you?",
            rising: "The persona you project—your rising sign—is one of freedom and adventure. But does anyone see the moments when you feel trapped? When the walls close in and even vast horizons feel too small?",
            deeper: "Your full chart reveals the quest you're truly on—not external adventures but the hero's journey within. There's wisdom to be claimed, teachings to be shared, a higher purpose waiting to be embraced."

        capricorn: {
            essence: "Capricorn sun, Saturn's disciplined child—you are the mountain climber, the goal achiever, the one who understands that anything worth having requires sustained effort. But who are you when you're not achieving? When you're just... being?",
            moon: "Your moon placement reveals emotional patterns shaped by duty and responsibility. But whose expectations are you really trying to meet? And what would happen if you gave yourself permission to rest?",
            rising: "Your rising sign presents capability and authority. People see the summit you've reached, but they don't see the lonely climb, the sacrifices made, the parts of yourself left behind.",
            deeper: "Your complete chart shows the path to balanced ambition, to success that doesn't cost you your soul. There are gifts in your tenth house, a legacy to build that serves both you and the collective."

            moon: "Your moon placement suggests emotional patterns that even you find unusual. You process feelings intellectually, which is both genius and defense. But emotions aren't meant to be solved, are they?",
            rising: "Your rising sign is the eccentric, the outlier, the one who doesn't quite fit. But here's the secret: you were never meant to fit. Your job is to break the mold, not squeeze into it.",

            moon: "Your moon placement amplifies your already oceanic emotional nature. You absorb others' feelings as your own, don't you? The challenge is learning where you end and others begin.",
